# thegame
This is the PHP Framework for The Game, an online "hacking" game for computerheads.

Please keep in mind this is a project in early development. I'm programming this
for releasing in my own website, and I decided to make it free just in
case someone finds it useful. The code here is just the framework for the game
(the brains), but it doesn't contain the "challenges" featured in it, as they
exist only on my database. I will provide, however, a sql file to create the
tables and some kind of admin interface at some point, so you can create your own!

# Tech things
This has been tested only with:
 * PHP 7.0.3
 * MySQL 5.6
 * nginx 1.9.12
Older/newer/different applications and software may or may not work.
